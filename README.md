# github_revision
Well I had forgotten how to use github. This is meant for revision. 
I am practicing at the same time.
I really want to type a lot. That is why I am adding so much of content.
Seeing the keyboard and typing has also become difficult now.
I have laernt a lot after entering here. Radisys is an awesome company to work. The problem is I am put into a very busy team and though people are trying to help me they dont have time. I want to learn as much as possible before my joining in the month of july as a full time employee. Too much of typing done. I need to continue with my work now. Okay..Bye.
